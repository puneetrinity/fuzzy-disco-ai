# AI-Enhanced Engineering Workflow

A world-class, team-oriented AI-enhanced engineering workflow that integrates Claude Code, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and multi-practitioner software engineering styles.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Practitioner Style Integration**: Channels wisdom from Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob, Kent Beck, Jessica Kerr, and Kelsey Hightower
- **Intelligent Auto-Style Selection**: Automatically selects the best practitioner approach based on task context
- **Team Coordination Workflows**: Advanced multi-developer collaboration and task distribution
- **MCP Server Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Code and other AI assistants
- **Production-Ready Quality**: Built with TypeScript, comprehensive testing, and operational excellence

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone and Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Workers of AI"
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📋 Usage

### MCP Server Tools

The workflow server provides the following tools:

#### 1. **select_practitioner_style**
Automatically selects the best practitioner style based on task context.

```json
{
  "taskType": "feature",
  "context": "Building a new user authentication system",
  "teamSize": 3
}
```

#### 2. **generate_code_with_style**
Generates code following a specific practitioner's style.

```json
{
  "practitioner": "uncle-bob",
  "codeType": "class",
  "requirements": "User authentication with JWT tokens",
  "language": "typescript"
}
```

#### 3. **coordinate_team_workflow**
Coordinates team workflows and task distribution.

```json
{
  "workflow": "feature-development",
  "teamMembers": ["alice", "bob", "charlie"],
  "priority": "high"
}
```

#### 4. **analyze_code_quality**
Analyzes code quality using multiple practitioner perspectives.

```json
{
  "code": "class UserService { ... }",
  "language": "typescript",
  "focusAreas": ["clean-code", "testing", "design"]
}
```

#### 5. **suggest_refactoring**
Suggests refactoring improvements based on practitioner wisdom.

```json
{
  "code": "legacy code here",
  "language": "javascript",
  "goals": ["maintainability", "testability"]
}
```

### Practitioner Styles

#### 🏛️ Martin Fowler - Evolutionary Design

- **Best for**: New feature development, maintainable systems
- **Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency inversion

#### 🔄 Kent Beck - Test-Driven Development
- **Focus**: TDD, simple design, rapid iteration
- **Best for**: Bug fixes, critical functionality
- **Principles**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle

#### ⚡ Jessica Kerr - Functional Programming
- **Focus**: Pure functions, immutability, composability
- **Best for**: Data processing, complex business logic
- **Principles**: Functional composition, predictable code

#### ☁️ Kelsey Hightower - Cloud-Native Excellence
- **Focus**: Production readiness, operational excellence
- **Best for**: Infrastructure, scalable systems
- **Principles**: Observability, automation, resilience

## 🤝 Team Workflows

2. **Investigation** (4-8 hours): Root cause analysis
3. **Fix** (1-3 days): Implementation with tests
4. **Validation** (1-2 days): QA testing and verification

### Code Review
1. **Preparation** (1 hour): Self-review, documentation
2. **Review** (2-4 hours): Multi-perspective analysis
3. **Revision** (1-2 hours): Address feedback
4. **Merge** (30 minutes): Final approval and merge

## 🔧 Development

### Scripts

- `npm run build`: Build TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run dev`: Build and start MCP server
- `npm start`: Start the built server
- `npm test`: Run tests (when implemented)

### VS Code Tasks

Use **Ctrl+Shift+P** → **Tasks: Run Task**:
